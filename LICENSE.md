🚀 Final Deployment Step
Since you are a DevOps pro now, push these files to GitHub to see your CI/CD pipeline turn green!

git add README.md LICENSE

git commit -m "docs: add readme and license for v1.2 release"

git push origin main

Would you like me to generate a "Release Tag" command for you so you can officially mark this as Version 1.2 on GitHub?
